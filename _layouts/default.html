Soon after the doctor arrived he died, but the TARDIS was passed onto a person of that time by the name Rontron3000YT, and the TARDIS is now constantly being renued by Rontron3000YT and Webbcode with there ultimate goal to make it work enough to tavel through time again someday...<br>TAPDIS<span> </span> <img src="/Realm-website/images/local5.png"> <span> </span>The TAPDIS was a model of a TARDIS, and also stuck in medievil time it has only two locations and can't go through time. The origonal owner is still alive and goes by the name of King_Clover_Pig.<span> </span>Webbcode's House<span> </span> <img src="/Realm-website/images/local4.png"><span> </span>Webbcode was a wizard, but no longer practices the art, but he can still sense when something changed in the world. When the Doctor came Webbcode sensed something had changed, so he went to find out what it was, and found out that the TARDIS was what changed. He eventually found out that Rontron3000YT was now in possession of the TARDIS and was trying to get it to traven through time again. So he offered to help and from now on that was there goal. To get the tardis to travel through time again someday...</p>
